# get-rid-of-index.xplr

This simple plugin removes the "index" column in the [xplr](https://github.com/sayanarijit/xplr) file manager. 

It just makes the interface cleaner if you are not using index navigation.


## Install

Use [xplr plugin manager](https://github.com/dtomvan/xpm.xplr/).


## In addition

To make the interface cleaner and more pleasant, I can also recommend the following plugins:
- [dysh-style.xplr](https://github.com/dy-sh/dysh-style.xplr)


## Alternative

- [one-table-column.xplr](https://github.com/duganchen/one-table-column.xplr)
